title: Ooh London
---

 A red eye flight out of Dublin Airport was helped by a Butlers chocolate and a flat white - a treat that has turned into an airport tradition whatever time of the day or night my flight is. So the whole point of this day trip to london was a visit to FOOD - Bigger than the plate that has been on all summer in the V&A.

So Tracie and I sipped our coffees, people watched and waited for our flight to board. Who doesn’t love to people, especially in an airport! An hour later we are standing in Stansted airport, trotting along to grab the Stansted Express (a great way to get to Victoria Station in 50 minutes) It runs very regularly so you never have much of a wait.

Our first stop on the grand tour was the Arcade Food Theater. Thankfully Tracie did some speedy research and got fab recommendations for the days eating! We rocked into the Aracde after some incorrect tubes but we finally made it. Having decided that we much before being above ground than under ground when lost :P

The Arcade Food Theater was a modern high end version of a food hall. It houses 7 of London’s best restaurants, 3 bars and coffee and pastries. This all day food theater brings together such a mixture of talent and taste all surrounded by tasteful architecture. When we walked into the space we were a little confused about the process and felt a bit lost. Having wandered around and found our feet our first stop was Pophams for a Rosemary and Seasalt twist. A munch and a read of the menu left each of us going in different directions to place an order. Wandering upstairs to TOU, I ordered the Iberian Katsu Sando - The Original, Toasted brioche, slow-cooked & deep fried Iberian pork neck, shredded cabbage, sliced onion, raspberry brown sauce, xo shallot sauce. Well now this was no ham-sambo - the crunch, sweet, crisp and beautiful lines of fat weaved through the pork….  Tracie hit up OKLAVA for the Iskender - Lamb & beef doner, chopped flatbread, tomato-chili sauce, yogurt, brown butter. Tucking into a great bomb of flavours and textures! Far from any donor I have consumer in recent times! It brought me back to a trip I had to Hamburg many moons ago, we made friends with a turkish kebab shop that had the front window filled with a table sized tray of baklava

The main event - Food at the V&A. It was a hughe immerion into our world of food today. We are all connected by food. It expolored the pleasure but also politics of what and how we eat today. It showed very clearly that hte future of food is in our hands!

So the second part of the days mission was to make it to one of 4 Bao across London. We rocked up with zero concept of time and lets be honest probley not overly hungery but where good food is concerned room can always be made! So Bao is a taiwenese buns. So bad news was it didnt open until 5.30pm and at 5.45pm we needed to have our bums on the tube rushing through rush hour traffic towards stansted! So big bubble burt but repaided swiftly when tracie spotted Brindisa Tapas accross the road! Off we trotted and sipped wine and nibbled happly on Gambas al Ajillo, Ensalada de berros and Monte Enebro. The food did not disappoint even though it was not a bao bun!

Story plot twist! As we gather ourselves and decide it’s time to leisurely head back towards Stansted Airport for our flight home we realise the gathering of people outside of Bao must signel its opening! As we join the end of the line we realise we may have skipped the lady behind us and we offer her her spot in the line back. She refuses and we start chatting as she is on her own. Between the long and the short of it, it turns out she was the manager of this Bao for the past year and had given up the role to focus more on her art. Suddenly forgetting our flight we trot into Bao with a personal guide to all the munching and tasting that needed to be had in Bao and boy it was good. With a warning that we only had 15 minutes and needed to catch out flight at 20.10 from Stansted. We ordered swiftly on a sheet where you number how many of each item you want and they started running out with these wonderful little plates! Given that we had just had our dinner we consumed an impressive amount! I loved that the menu had the option of having one of everything - my kinda menu! Just as we are finishing up our news friends agree that we need to try the orgional! Word is sent to the kitchen that two orgionals are needed pronto as we are already 15 minutes late leaving!

It was an anaxous trip back to stansted with a bit of clock watching but all made easier dreaming about that orgional bao covered in crushed peanuts! Hmmmm any missed flight would have been worth it
