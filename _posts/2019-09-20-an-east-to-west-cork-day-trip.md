title: An east to west Cork day trip
---
â€‹
This is a take on a salad I had while on holidays on south west cork this summer. We took a road trip from Ardmore, Waterford  along the coast stopping in Kinsale, Ballinspittle, Courtmacsherry and finally Clonakilty. A day trip that was filled with beautiful views and county roads. Also some roadside egg purchases from an honesty box.

We sit off on this trip earlyish for a holiday start. On the Sunday one of the group has ripped out an article from the Irish times recommending a visit to Ballinspittle and a recommended itinerary for the day. Yes this is the village of the moving statues....

All set with our recommended breakfast plans in place thanks to The Irish Times weekend edition we set off with just a coffee and a digestive to sustain us.

Ballinspittle did not read the weekend times and were unaware or did not think people would venture out to visit. So unfortunately the first stop on the schedule was closed Monday and Tuesday. So we called it quits on the Ballinspittle itinerary and decided to freelance it!

As we still hadn't had breakfast we took an essential coffee stop in a little spot called the Diva Boutique Bakery. There was no seating inside but a perfectly positioned bench just outside the door. We plopped down, soaked up some rays, sipped very good coffee and munched on a once of the best sausage rolls I have had in a long time.  Once our crumbly pastry covered sausage rolls were consumed (that didn't take long) off we went back to the car and drove to Garretstown beach. Consumed the last of our coffee and hit the road west, unsure where we would end up.

Quickly upon taking the coast road west away from Garrettstown beach surfers we found a yellow honesty box that had chickens eggs and jams. Having rummaged around the car and handbags for changes we filled our basket with fresh eggs, dropped out cash in the sweet tin and hit the road, delighted with our find for breakfast tomorrow.

 Next we soaked up some historical culture of the Timoleague Friary which is located perched over the Courtmacsherry bay. A pit stop for a little history and a stretch of the legs. Also what amazing architecture they have across the countryside, one building just better than the next.


Having consulted the map we decided being so close to Courtmacsherry, we needed to visit there local CoOp / Community Shop (https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/first-of-its-kind-community-shop-in-courtmacsherry-gets-green-light-377270.html). What a little gem it was. Upstairs is filled with second hand books, perfect for summer time reading, a local notice board sharing all the local news, a parcel drop off service (small town parcel motel service), all your food items you might need and some great fresh Fields of Skibbereen bread (this resulted in a late late night tayto sambo upon arrival home.... boy it was good!). Having seen all that Courtmacsherry had to offer we consulted our traditional papermap and decided to head towards the direction of Clonakilty for our dinner/ Lunch / cake stop....

On the outskirts of the town I spotted Scally's Supervalu and made a pit stop. Scally's could teach the rest of retail world a thing of two about presentation, reduced packaging and inviting products. This supermakes is setting the bar high with such a great selection of fresh local product, home made/ inhouse product and lots of Irish producers. Next we headed over to Meadow and Byrnes for some non-food related shopping. Feeling a little hungry we popped into the attached cafe, Fig & Olive. Now don't let the canteen dark feel to the place turn you off, the food was morish. My partner in crime had a prawn cocktail on brown bread, piled high with tethering mount of prawns covered in a glossy Marie Rose sauce. I ordered the daily special salad. This was listed on the board as Gubbeen chorizo and potatoes, not overly sure what to expect. I was not let down upon arrival! As a reminder of this summer adventure I have recreated this easy salad here. Such a simple and tasty dish with great opportunity to show off our irish pantry.

Deciding to share the love we headed off for the centre of town in search for a coffee and cake pit stop. Having found parking - a little tricky there was lots of road works going on. We set off on finding all the coffee shops we passed during our quest for a parking spot. Each coffee shop was more promising that the next. We finally sat ourselves down in a bright coffee shop called Sticky Buns. I think it was the name that was the deciding factor!! We had some delish lemonly butter cake and a shot off coffee to wave us on our way.

As the day was drawing to and end and we really needed to make the long journey back to base we finished off our day with a little Retail Therapy, said goodbye to Clonakilty promising we would be back.
