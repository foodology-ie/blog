title: Lemony Salad Dressing
---

â€‹This simple salad dressing is a great addition to your repertoire. Inspired from my summer road trip to Cork - It works wonderfully with the Gubbeen Chorizo, Irish potatoes  and leafy salad - here......

Ingredients
Whole  grain mustard
Honey
Salt
Fresh black pepper
Olive oil
Lemon zest
Lemon Juice
Minced Garlic

Utensils

If you have an empty jam jar around this  is the easiest way to make salad dressing  -  I used my near empty jar of  whole  grain mustard to make this dressing

Salad Dressing
1 - Add all ingredients into jam jar and shake
2 - once all combined make sure and taste
3 adjust accordingly - more honey for sweetness, lemon for vinegary, olive oil to thin
