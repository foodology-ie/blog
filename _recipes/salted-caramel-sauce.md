title: Salted caramel sauce
---

I love this recipe it is very easy but always make sure that it gets a nice deep golden colour - be patient! It is worth the wait. Let the caramel cool before stirring in the salt crystals if you would like them whole and a little crunch of saltiness.

225g (8oz) caster or granulated sugar
75ml (3fl oz) of water
110g (4oz) butter
175ml (6fl oz) double or regular cream
Good pinch of salt or to change it up some smoked saltâ€¦.

Place the sugar in a saucepan with 75ml (3fl oz) of water and set over a medium heat, stirring the syrup as it heats up to dissolve the sugar.
Once the sugar has dissolved, stir in butter, then turn the heat to high and cook for about 10 minutes or until the mixture turns a toffee colour. Do not stir the mixture as it cooks, though you might need to swirl the saucepan occasionally if you see the caramel turning golden on one side of the pan before the other.
Once the caramel is a rich golden toffee colour, take it off the heat for a moment and stir in half the cream. When the bubbles die down, stir in the rest of the cream and salt to taste.
