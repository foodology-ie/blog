This granola changes everytime as I don't stick strictly to the fruits, nuts and seeds. Feel free to change it up and add what ingredients you have in the cupboard. I like to use large curls of coconut as the desiccated coconut just disappears

Ingredients:
2 tbsp Vegetable oil
125ml maple syrup
2 tbsp honey
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
300g rolled oats (not highly processed - Aldi have a nice organic version that work great)
150g seeds
100g nuts
100g dried fruit
50g coconut curls

Method:
Preheat the over to 150'C
mix all the wet ingredients on a jug
add all ingredients (except the dried fruit and coconut) to a large bowl and mix well
Spread out evenly and thinly on a low sided baking sheet. You might need to spread it over a number of sheets
Cook for 15 minutes toss every so often. After 15 minutes add all remaining ingredients and cook for a further 15 minutes
when golden remove from the oven and leave on the counter until totally cool - tossing regularly to help keep the granola crunchy
add to a airtight container and enjoy with yogurt

I have often make this with more fruit and nuts if the mood takes me. The recipe is a rough guide for you making this. I have often brought this as a gift to someone where it is much appreciated and a useful luxury. When gifting I place the granola in a mason jar that you find in your location kitchen shop or IKEA. Add a piece of twine and a label to finish off the rustic look.
