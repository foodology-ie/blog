title: Bread and Butter Pudding
---

This is the easiest bread and butter pudding recipe I have ever come across! The fact that you do not have to butter the bread or stack it nearly is a god sent! Just cube and soak - easy peasy
250g While crustless stale bread cubed!
450ml cream
225 milk
4 eggs
Vanilla extract
110g sugar & extra for top
Butter - grease dish
100g dark chocolate/ milk / white or raisins….


Grease the dish 20cm x 20cm oven proof dish (just make sure its deep and will fit the bread, layered
Cube the bread roughly into inch sided pieces toss into oven proof dish with raisins or chocolate
Mix all other ingredients together and pour over bread
Allow to soak for 30 minutes minimum
Just before putting into the over sprinkle sugar on top.
Bake in the oven at 170’C until golden brown and set (with a little wobble)

The pudding will puff up and then drop when cooled. This is not a problem it will still take as good
