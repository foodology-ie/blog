---

​This has become my new experimental food to make. It is a simple yeast dough recipe that has such flexibility - sweet and savoury. Once you have succeeded at the basic yeast dough, move on to a world of combination takes your fancy. I would encourage you to keep it simple and make the bun dough and sugar glaze it / drizzle with icing the first time. Then once you have a grasp of the basic recipe set sail into a world of bun dough possibilities.
