---

So my summer road trip inspired salad - Gubeen Chrizo, Irish potatoes  and leafy salad.

Serves

Ingredients - Salad
New baby potatoes
Green beans
Mixed lettuce leaves
Chrizo

1 - make the salad dressing as per the lemon dressing recipe found here
2 - Steam potatoes until cooked  - be careful not to over cook. Once    cooked be   sure   to run under cold water until cold
3 - Cook the  green beans in fresh boiling water until al delta - you want to keep a  fresh crisp bite in the green beans. Once cooked  run them under ice cold water until cold
4 - Prep and clean salad  leaves
5 - in a frying pan lightly cook the chorizo until it  starts to release its fats  to the pan. Remove the chorizo from the pan and set aside   but leave all the parikia  filled fat behind (mmmm)
6 - lightly smash / smooch the baby potatoes (break the skin roughly. Add to the chorizo fat and heat. When the potatoes have absorbed all the chorizo from the pan and developed a few   crispy edges
7 - in a large bowl dress the salad with zesty lemon dressing and arrange on a large place
8 - Arrange the green beans on top of the lettuce leaves and scatter the potatoes and crhizo around the edge of the dish

Ingredients  - Salad dressing
Whole  grain mustard
Lemon zest
Lemon Juice

Olive oil

Utensils

If you have an empty jam jar around this  is the easiest way to make salad dressing  -  I used my near empty jar of  whole  grain mustard to make this dressing

Salad Dressing
1 - Add all ingredients into jam jar and shake
2 - once all combined make sure and taste
3 adjust accordingly - more honey for sweetness, lemon for vinegary, olive oil to thin
