---

This is one of my favorite sides to serve with christmas dinner or as a recent treat I cooked this and served with a piece of roast wild venison that was a lovely gift received in a food barter and some steams greens for a lift of colour.

Ingredients
1 tbsp butter
1 red onion, thinly sliced
1 small red cabbage
5 tbsp balsamic vinegar
3 tbsp soft brown sugar
1 tsp mixed spice
2 tbsp redcurrant jelly
â€‹100ml water
175g blackberries (if available)
2 tbsp creme de mure / creme de cassis (if available)

Melt the butter in a large saucepan, add onion and cook slowly until soft.
add the cabbage, vinegar, sugar, mixed spice and half the jelly along with 100ml of water and seaon. Bring to the boil and cover, cook for 40 minutes over a medium/ low heat
add the blackberries and creme de mure / creme de cassis and continue cooking for 5 / 10 munutes until the liquid has evaporated and the blackberries has broken down slightly.
