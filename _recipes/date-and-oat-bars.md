title: Date and Oat Bars
---

These are flapjack style bars. I have made this recipe without oranges. I also sometimes try a clear out of seeds and nuts from my presses so it does not always contain the below seeds and nuts. Just ensure the weight matches but use whatever ingredients are in your kitchen. Be Careful toasting the seeds and nuts - they burn so quickly!

50g almonds
50g cashew nuts
200g jumbo rolled oats
35g pumpkin seeds
35g sunflower seeds
15g sesame seeds
120g dates
180g butter
140g demerara sugar
75g golden syrup
Zest 1 orange
2tsp orange blossom water (If you don’t have this some orange juice will work too)
1tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp salt

Preheat the oven to 180’C. Line a baking tray (30 x 20cm) and leave aside
Spread the nuts on a separate tray and roast for 10 minutes or until starting to turn golden. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool before. If using flaked almonds add them half way through the roasting
If you have a food processor / soup gun, close to hand place 80g of oats into the processor and blitz into small pieces.
Add the dates, seeds, oats, blitzed oats and nuts to a large bowl.
Place the butter, sugar, golden syrup and orange zest into a medium size saucepan over a medium heat. Stir gently until the butter mets and the mixture comes together. Remove from the heat and stir through the orange blossom water, cinnamon and salt.
Combine all wet and dry ingredients.
Tip into a lined baking tray and spread mixture evenly and press into the tray.
Bake for 35 minutes or until dark golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 30 minutes before cutting into portions. Make sure and leave them in the tray until they are completely cooled.
