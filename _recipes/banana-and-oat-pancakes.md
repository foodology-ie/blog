These must be the best go to breakfast I love have at the moment. I really enjoy them after the gym. They feels like an utter treat when making them after a workout without undoing all the good work in the gym! Such a flexiable recipe - think chocolate chips, blueberries or even some coconut throughout! The tick to these guys is not to turn them too soon as they will fall apart. Be paitaint cook on a low to medium heat and wait, wait, wait until your turn them over.

2 banana
1 Large Egg
2 tbsp Rolled Oats
¼ tsp Baking Powder
¼ tsp Vanilla extract
¼ tsp Ground Cinnamon
1 tsp Butter

Mash the bananas with a fork
Whisk the egg and add to the mashed bananas
Combine all other dry ingredients into the banana mix.
On a medium heat melt the butter in a large frying pan
Spoon 2tbsp of mixture into the pan per pancake
Allow to cook until the top is set and then flip. Once both sides are brown
Then dress your pancakes and serve as you wish
