Cake mixture
​175g soft butter
175g caster sugar

1/2 teaspoons almond extract
​125g plain white flour
100g ground almonds
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
about 1 tablespoon milk

2 tablespoons flaked almonds

Equipment

​
Prepare 1/2 the quantity of sweet shortcrust pastry found here and leave to relax in the fridge. This can be prepared in advance. If you make the full amount of pastry keep half in the fridge for 1 week or cover well and place in the freezer

Preheat the oven to 180'C
Beat the butter and sugar in the food-mixer until light and fluffy
Add the eggs and almond extract
Sieve the flour and baking powder and add slowly to the mixture
Add milk if mixture is too stiff (it should fall off the spoon with ease)

Remove the pastry from the fridge and roll out to about 4mm thick. Cut into squares large enough to cover the base and sides of your muffin tin
​Oil the tin well and fill each well with a square of pastry
Top the pastry with a teaspoon of jam and cover with the almond mixture. Ensure that no jam is exposed.
Top with some flaked almonds for decoration
Bake @ 180'c until golden brown and set

Cool and enjoy
