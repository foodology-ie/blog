A brownie can go so wrong but a good brownie is perfection! Crunchy top with a soft moist inside! When I make these and I want to add an extra dazzle to these brownie I make a batch of salted caramel and put doples of it within the mixture! This recipe can be found over here!

225g Chocolate (Close to 70% cocoa solids) melted
275g butter, softened
340g caster sugar
4 eggs
75g good-quality cocoa powder (I use green & blacks)
70g plain flour
1 tsp salt
½ tsp baking powder

Oven Temp 170’C
Swiss roll tin 31cm x 21cm and 4cm deep ( I like to use a larger tin and have a slightly thinner brownie

Preheat the oven to 170’C and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper
Melt your chocolate gently. When nearly all chocolate is melted stir to melt the last few pieces left of solid chocolate. Chocolate burns super quick!
Cream the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer or good old wooden spoon.
Gradually add the eggs to the mixture. Keep mixing until all ingredients are combined into a soft fudgy mass
Add the melted chocolate
Now add all your dry ingredients at once and ensure everything is well combined. The mixture will be stiff
Spread the mixture out into your lined tray building up slightly towards the edges
Pop into the over on the middle shelf. Check after 25 minutes and check it again after every 5 - 10 minutes. It should wobble in the centre but not liquidy.
Remove from the oven when the perfect wobble has been found and allow to cool. Do not cut until it has cooled or you will have a mess!
