A quick evening supper that never fails to please. Don’t feel restricted to stick closely to this recipe. This recipe is for an easy dinner - I don’t weigh any of the ingredients and just go by eye! Pasta shape is indifferent on a Monday evening!  However something that will hold the sauce is best. I have tried this with gin when I realised too late that there was no vodka in the house. The outcome was not unpleasing but vodka is best.

4 portions of pasta according to the packets recommended portion
1 generous tablespoon of butter
1 packet of bacon/ pancetta bits or 4 rashers chopped
4 tablespoon vodka
200ml  cream - I just buy one regurlar sized tub of cream and use
3 tablespoon tomato purée
A small handful of fresh flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
A small fist full of mature chedder

Cook the pasta according to the instructions
In a frying pan, melt the butter over a medium head and add the bacon bits. Cook until lightly golden.
Add the vodka to the pan and simmer for a few minutes.
Add the cream, tomato puree and season (easy on the salt!). Simmer for a few minutes until slightly thicken
Add ⅔ of the mature chedder and stir in and finish with the chopped parsley.
Add the cooked pasta to the frying pan and coat genersously with the sauce.
Serve in a large bowl and finish with a little chopped parsley and mature cheddar.
