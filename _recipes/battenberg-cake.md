- 175g Butter
- 175g Caster sugar
- 3 eggs
- 175g self raising flour
- Few drops pink colouring
- Few drops Rose water
- 3 tbs apricot jam (sieved)
- 350g almond icing
- Caster sugar for dusting


1. Preheat the oven to 180â€™C and assemble, grease and flour the Battenberg tin
2. Cream together the butter and sugar together until light and creamy
3. Gradually add the beaten eggs. Fold in the flour
4. Divide the mixture into two equal halves. Put a few drops of pink food colouring into one half of the mixture and gently mix until an even colour is achieved.
5. Spoon the pink mixture into two sections of the tin and the plain mixture into the other two sections.
6. Place in the centre of the oven and bake for approximately 30 - 35 minutes or until evenly coloured and firm to the touch. Allow the cake to cool in the tin.
7. If the cake has risen above the top of the tin, use a serrated knife to cut across the top of remove excess cake. Remove the cake from the tin.
8. When completely cold, brush the apricot jam onto the long sides of the cakes and join one plain and one pink slice together and then one prink and one plain on top creating a checkered pattern.
9. Now brush the apricot jam over the long sides.
10. Roll out the marzipan on some caster sugar making a rectangle (20x30cm). Neaten the edges.
11. Pleace the cake onto the marzipan so one edge is lined up to the edge of the marzipan and completely wrap the marzipan around the cake
12. Trim away any surplus marzipan and to make a neat cake, just trim both ends with a clean knife.

Options - substitute the pink colour for lemon or chocolate
