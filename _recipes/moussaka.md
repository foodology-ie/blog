A summer holiday on the Island of Crete is where I first discovered this dish. There are a number of different versions - some with potatoes, a mixture of lamb and veal mince. This is a great dish to have assembled and made in advance. Just take it out of the fridge about 1 hour before cooking. Serve with a crisp green salad
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 3 medium / 2 large aubergines, sliced
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 4 clovers of garlic, finely chopped
- 1.5 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 500g minced lamb
- 2 tbsp tomato puree
- 150ml water
- 150ml red wine
- Salt & pepper
- small bunch of flat leafed parsley, chopped

For the bechamel:
- 500ml milk
- 60g butter
- 60g plain flour
- 50g strong cheese, grated
- 2 eggs beaten (optional)
- Nutmeg

1. Pre-heat the oven to 180C. Cut the aubergines lengthways into 0.5cm slices. Salt lightly and leave on a teatowel to remove some liquid. Then put them on to oiled baking sheets. Brush with olive oil and season. Bake for about 25 minutes until soft, golden and floppy.

2. Meanwhile, put 2 tbsp olive oil into a large frying pan over a medium high heat and cook the onion until soft. Add the garlic, cinnamon and oregano and cook for a further couple of minutes, then stir in the lamb. Turn up the heat slightly, and brown the lamb well, cooking until the mixture is quite dry. Stir in the tomato and wine, bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down low or pop into the oven and cook for 30â€“40 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated. Season and stir in the parsley.

3. Meanwhile, make the bechamel. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir the flour into the butter and cook for a couple of minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk until you have a thick sauce and no lumps. Then stir in the cheese until melted and add nutmeg, salt & pepper to taste. Take off the heat and allow to cool slightly, then beat in the eggs (optional if you wish to enrich the sauce) and slightly more nutmeg than you might think wise.

4. Arrange a third of the aubergines in the base of an oven dish, and top with half the meat. Repeat these layers, then finish off with a layer of aubergine, and top with the sauce. Bake for about 45 minutes until well browned and bubbling. If you leave to cool for 15 minutes it will be easier to slice.

Tip: If you have old cheese in the fridge that is dried up and a little nearer the bin than a cheese board - this bechamel is the perfect place to use it!
