Ottolenghi's Spiced apple cake is the perfect winter evening comfort cake. Served warm with sour cream or some vanilla ice cream. The cake mixture is a very thick batter. Organically spread the apples across the top of the mixture. If you don't have the mixture of different types of apples just work with what you have.

CAKE BATTER
130g butter, room temperature and cubed
150g caster sugar
3 large eggs, lightly whisked
2 tsp vanilla extract
300g self-raising flour
⅓ tsp salt
200g soured cream

APPLE TOPPING
2 large Bramley apples, peeled, cored and cut into 1½ cm wide wedges (460g prepped weight)
1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and cut into 1½ cm wide wedges (125g prepped weight)
130g demerara sugar
1 tbsp mixed spice

METHOD
Preheat the oven to 160C fan (180C/gas 4). Grease and line a 23cm round cake tin.
Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Beat on a medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla, a little at a time, until incorporated. Sift together the flour and salt and add this in a couple of batches to the batter, alternating with the soured cream. Turn the machine off as soon as everything is incorporated. Spoon the batter into the cake tin and set aside.
Place all the apple slices in a bowl. Mix together the sugar and mixed spice and sprinkle over the apple. Toss to coat, then spoon over the cake batter. Bake for 60-65 minutes, until the mixture has risen up around the apple and the top is crisp, firm and golden-brown. A knife inserted into the mix will not come out clean, as the apples are wet, but you can tell the cake is cooked when you give the tin a little shake and the top doesn’t wobble.
Remove from the oven and set aside for about 30 minutes before removing from the tin.
Serve either slightly warm or at room temperature. When slicing, use a serrated knife to prevent the apples from tearing.
